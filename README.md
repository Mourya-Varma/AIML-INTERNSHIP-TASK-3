Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Netflix Dataset
AI & ML Internship: Task 3 

Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" dataset. The primary goal is to understand data patterns, analyze feature behaviors, and extract meaningful insights through visualization.




Objectives
Identify the distribution of numerical and categorical features.

Detect outliers within the dataset using statistical visualizations.


Analyze relationships between different features through correlation.


Provide actionable insights based on data findings.



Tools & Libraries Used

Python: Core programming language.


Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.


Matplotlib: For basic static visualizations.


Seaborn: For advanced statistical data visualization.

Key EDA Steps

Numerical Distribution: Plotted histograms to visualize the spread of numerical data.


Categorical Analysis: Utilized count plots to analyze the frequency of categories like content type (Movie vs. TV Show).


Outlier Detection: Implemented box plots to identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm.


Feature Relationship: Generated a correlation heatmap to understand how different variables interact.


Predictive Insights: Identified key features that are most important for future prediction tasks.
